.SH NAME
powernap \- configurable daemon that will run at a specified INTERVAL, executing an ACTION when all of a list of monitored PROCESSES are missing from the system process table for a contiguous ABSENCE seconds

.SH DESCRIPTION
powernap will run ACTION when none of a set of PROCESSES have executed for some number of ABSENCE seconds.

The powernap daemon will check the process table using "pgrep -f" every INTERVAL seconds.  Note that PROCESSES taking less than INTERVAL seconds to execute may be overlooked by powernap.  Choose your INTERVAL value accordingly.  These parameters are configured in \fI/etc/powernap/config\fP.

Use "ps -eo args" for sample output for development of your regular expressions, and use "pgrep -f" for testing your regular expressions.

It acts as a sort of "screensaver" for servers, watching the process table for activity rather than the keyboard or mouse.  For instance, PowerNap can automatically "pm-suspend" a system if no instance of "kvm" runs for some contiguous block of "300" seconds, checking the process table every "10" seconds.
