.SH NAME
powernap \- configurable daemon that will run an ACTION when all of a list of monitored PROCESSES are missing from the system process table for ABSENCE seconds

.SH DESCRIPTION
powernap will run ACTION when none of PROCESSES have executed for some number of ABSENCE seconds.  The powernape daemon will check the process table using "pgrep -f" every DELAY seconds.  Note that PROCESSES taking less than DELAY seconds to execute may be overlooked by powernap.  Choose your DELAY value accordingly.  These parameters are configured in \fI/etc/powernap/config\fP.

It acts as a sort of "screensaver" for servers, watching the process table for activity rather than the keyboard or mouse.  For instance, PowerNap can automatically "pm-suspend" a system if no instance of "kvm" runs for some contiguous block of "300" seconds.
