Description: run a defined action if not running some particular processes
 PowerNap will run an administrator-specified ACTION when none of a list of
 MONITORED_PROCESSES have executed for some number of ABSENT_SECONDS,
 checking the process table every INTERVAL_SECONDS.
 .
 PowerNap can be used to bring a running system to a lower power state when
 none of a list of critical processes have run for some amount of time.  It
 can act as sort of a "screensaver" for servers, watching the process table
 for activity rather than the keyboard or mouse.
 .
 For instance, PowerNap can automatically "pm-suspend" a system if no instance
 of "kvm" runs for some contiguous block of "300" seconds, checking the process
 table every "1" second.
