# This is the configuration file for PowerNap.
# See powernap(1) for more information.

# This file is Python syntax, and will be sourced by the powernap daemon
# on start.
# To enact changes to this configuration, restart the daemon.

# Processes to monitor.
# The MONITORED_PROCESSES variable should be a Python list of quoted regular
# expressions.
# Each item in this list will be passed to: pgrep -f <item>
# Examples:
#   MONITORED_PROCESSES = [  "^/usr/bin/kvm", "sshd: " ]
#   MONITORED_PROCESSES = [  "^/usr/bin/mplayer", "^/usr/bin/xine", "^/usr/bin/mythfrontend" ]
MONITORED_PROCESSES = []

# Number of seconds that all processes must be absent from the process table.
# Example:
# ABSENT_SECONDS = 300
ABSENT_SECONDS = 300

# Quoted shell command(s) to run when all MONITORED_PROCESSES have not executed
# for ABSENT_SECONDS.
# Use "ps -eo args" to define these.
# Examples:
#   ACTION = "/usr/sbin/pm-suspend"
#   ACTION = "/usr/sbin/pm-hibernate"
#   ACTION = "/sbin/poweroff"
#   ACTION = "echo 'I am wasting electricity' | mail AlGore@example.com"
ACTION = ""

# Minimum run time of a process in the list of MONITORED_PROCESSES.
# The powernap daemon will wake every INTERVAL_SECONDS and check the process
# table for matching processes.  Lower values of INTERVAL_SECONDS will provide
# more detailed process monitoring but will consume more system resources.
# Higher values of INTERVAL_SECONDS will consume less system resources, but
# might miss processes that execute for less than INTERVAL_SECONDS.
INTERVAL_SECONDS = 10
